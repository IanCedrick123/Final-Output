            <p>
                Hi there! My name is Ian Cedrick Egipto and I'm the creator of this program. I have a passion for Web Designing, and I've developed this program to showcase all that I learned so far.
            </p>
            <p>
                I believe that creating this program is great in itself. My goal is to preserve what I did and show it to people.

                This Program is designed to showcase an example of an e-commerce website and its our final output.
            </p>
            <p>
                Whether you're a classmate, this program aims to show what I'm capable of.
